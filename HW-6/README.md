Turns out, I am probably not cut out for this. Perhaps I am and I am just missing the minor things. I don't know. But for this week, I just couldn't understand how to parse results no matter how much I tried to figure it out. 
I walked away for a day, came back and still nothing. I spend more time in this class than any other. I just want to learn JavaScript so badly! Why does it not want me??
