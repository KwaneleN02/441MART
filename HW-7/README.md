The Strugles:
I think I did better with this assignment except wrapping my head around calling my image paths in javaScript. I have to remember that this is not html and css. 
I also struggled with my spelling issues. I need to slow down. I am still learning loops, so that's still a bit of a struggle. 
Debugging is definitely getting better, but still have a lot to impove on. 

The good: 
Hey, it was nice helping a fellow classmate on JavaScript. Hahaha. I feel so much better when I can help them with html and css. Made me realize how comfortable I got with it, 
so being able to help someone here and there showed I knew something. It was good. 
Also, I actually got my code to work first try (despite the issues with my images). I built the whole thing and didn't have errors until I started adding images. So that was encouraging.
