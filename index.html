        <h1 class="About">About
            <p class="me">Life student first. Digital Art, or perhaps Media Arts student hoping to niche in Web Design, 
            Graphic Design (specifically logo designing) and digital publication. 
            Not really a niche considering everything that's involved, but who's judging?</p>

            <p class="me">So, considering that I have a niche in mind... Well, let's just pretend that I do. What exactly am I good at? Remember the first words to this section? 
                "Life student first"! It's almost like an aha moment when you get it. But, I am good at that. I can learn just about anything, and that's my greatest talent. 
                I like to attribute myself as a write. Content creator, but I am so good at identifying marketing and advertising trends and strategies.
            </p>
            <p class="me">
                I pursued the Media Arts degree because I truly believe that we, as a people, aren't so good at what we're good at. Sounds weird, but stay with me. This philosophy of my own
                is explained as such, talents are great, but talents are a comfort place. There is little to no progression or growth in comfort. But when we challenge ourselves, and we overcome those challenges, 
                it is then that we can attribute ourselves as being "good" at something. To conlcude this section. I am a good learner. It is a talent ***Wink***
