Okay, so I understand Arrays as a container to store multiple values. Sort of like a function, but a function can hold one value. I get that. 
I understand why loops are important. I don't understand how to use them. For an example (var i = 0; i < imageIds.length; i++); I don't understand the structure of this and what it means. 
Perhaps I also need to go back and learn some more in depth on Math functions and loops. I do understand, however that (while a count is < or > a number of arrays then loops contunue or stop depending on that value). 
Those were my greatest struggles.
