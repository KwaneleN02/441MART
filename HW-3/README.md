Greatest challenge for this week was to have my buttons reset back to the beginning after all options have been exhausted. I overcame them by logging into Discord and asked on a forum how to accomplish this. Prof. Cassens came to the rescue and gave me two options to help me with the issue. 
I had little understandign to the onclick attribute. I referenced provided link from W3 Schools to accomplish this.
